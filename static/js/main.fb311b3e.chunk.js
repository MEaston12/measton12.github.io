VBA is probably my least favorite language to use, but it is nearly unrivaled in its ability to be natively integrated into office workflows (Excel and Microstation both natively support it), so I started learning more and more of its quirks until I became proficient enough to write scripts that automated hours-long tedious tasks away into seconds of quick execution.  In my career I also found Autohotkey to be immensely helpful in process optimization as well.  The language itself is a bit of a headache but it has some seriously impressive support for generalized automation of tasks at the window manager/user input level."}),Object(b.jsx)("p",{children:"It was during this time that I was approached to handle the development and rollout of a web application for my company.  I accepted the challenge and found a great tutorial on MDN that went over development of web applications via Node.js.  It was at this point that I completely fell in love with Node and web development.  I successfully created a web application that used server-side rendering via Pug to deliver a Mapbox map app to users that would allow them to add points onto a map that displayed a prospective project.  On the project manager's end, the application would display those comments as a list of cards adjacent to a map with a set of tools for managing the comments."}),Object(b.jsx)("p",{children:"Having had my first taste of web app development, I decided I needed more, and enrolled in the Univesity of Utah's Coding Bootcamp program.

That's been a fun venture to be involved in, though the majority of the coding has been done by my partner, I have been pair programming with him to work out difficult problems.
