        <p>
          Hello there, my name is Malcolm Easton and welcome to my portfolio! You should be able
          to use the Navbar above to navigate around, and the Footer below should contain some links to my social medias and whatnot.

        <h2>Coding History</h2>
        <p>
          My first real experience programming was competing in MIT's Zero Robotics competition in high school back in 2010.
          It was a nationwide coding competition where the goal was to use the C language to program the behavior of a floating 'spheres'
          robot that could perform 3D translations and rotations in microgravity.  The team I played for, Cyprus High School, managed to 
          take fourth place nationally, with our coding actually being uploaded to and run on the International Space Station.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, I went to Utah State University to study Electrical Engineering with a side interest in Computer Science and Computer Engineering.
          This is where I picked up my skills in C++ and my general understanding of computer systems.  These were some of my favorite courses
          in that time:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Data Structures: Implementing memory structures like linked lists, binary trees, or hashes.</li>
          <li>Digital Circuits: Designing logic circuits using boolean logic gates and programming FPGAs using Verilog.</li>
          <li>Numerical Approximations: Writing code to calculate approximate solutions to difficult mathematical problems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I started my career in CAD work back in 2015, during which I developed a great interest in process optimization.  VBA is probably my least favorite
          language to use, but it is nearly unrivaled in its ability to be natively integrated into office workflows (Excel and Microstation both natively support it),
          so I started learning more and more of its quirks until I became proficient enough to write scripts that automated hours-long tedious tasks 
          away into seconds of quick execution.  In my career I also found Autohotkey to be immensely helpful in process optimization as well.  The language itself
          is a bit of a headache but it has some seriously impressive support for generalized automation of tasks at the window manager/user input level.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was during this time that I was approached to handle the development and rollout of a web application for my company.  I accepted the challenge
          and found a great tutorial on MDN that went over development of web applications via Node.js.  It was at this point that I completely fell in love with
          Node and web development.  I successfully created a web application that used server-side rendering via Pug to deliver a Mapbox map app to users that would
          allow them to add points onto a map that displayed a prospective project.  On the project manager's end, the application would display those comments as a list
          of cards adjacent to a map with a set of tools for managing the comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having had my first taste of web app development, I decided I needed more, and enrolled in the Univesity of Utah's Coding Bootcamp program.
          I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the course and discovered how awesome React is.  I've learned a ton of skills that are relevant to Full-Stack
          Web Dev.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also started and own stake in a profitable independent web app LLC, Tupperbox LLC. That's been a fun venture to be involved in, though the majority of 
          the coding has been done by my partner, he and I have pair programmed quite a bit, I've helped him in finding solutions, and I've been handling much of 
          the business, organization, planning, and legal aspects of the business.  Now that I've completed the Coding Bootcamp I look forward to contributing more 
          directly on the project.
